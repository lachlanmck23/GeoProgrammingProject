# GeoProgrammingProject
Data and code repository for Geospatial Programming major project

Grocery.zip contains original grocery store point data

Hospitals.zip contains original hospital point data

WhitehorseAddressesFull.zip contains address point data for all of Whitehorse, 
not working with script as dataset too large

Whitehorse20Addresses.zip contains address point data consisting of 20 addresses, 
works with script as proof of concept

ParklandNotMerged.zip contains parkland vector file, which would be used in full/non-functional version of 
script, but buffering to dissolve within a distance would not work with size of dataset in a script

ParklandMergedandSplit.zip contains parkland vector file used in functional version of script, 
has already been dissolved manually with toolbox, so can skip this step in script

FinalAddressFileWScore20Addresses.zip contains final address point file output after functional script run with Whitehorse20Addresses.zip. 
Script completes, but only works with smaller datasets.
